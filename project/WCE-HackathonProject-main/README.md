# Food Wastage recommendation system

**Problem Discription with valid solution**

According to the problem we have decided to make an web based application where there is different options are given to select if you are the consumer
      (user) or if you are the donor both have to do registration according to the choose domain. Basically our application is for NGO’s and other people can also
      use it. In our application there are different items are given according to variety in food. We have built a recommender system for the consumer based on the
      food items are frequently consumed and expiry. Therefore also helping the donor donate. Reducing food waste at retail, food service and household label can
      provide multifaceted benefits for both people and planet. There is a chatbot on the home page if user has any doubt how to order or how to donate or any query
      related to our website they can get answer there and we are also using filtration to check the food quality.


## Discription

itemitem based collaborative filtering to recommend the items which expire early and are more 
in consumption.The items which we see on the screen are the items which are recommended by 
recommendation system engine and these items are filtered based on their expiry date and the 
consumption.

of food on daily basis and the ideal view of the consumers will help the engine to see the area 
of self improvement.We have also shown the type of food preferred both by the donor and the consumer.

 donations.We ask him to share all the necessary details about his donation and push his donation in our inventory.
